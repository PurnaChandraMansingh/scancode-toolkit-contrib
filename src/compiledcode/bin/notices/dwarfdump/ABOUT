note: though we use dwarfdump and not dwarfdump2 we ALWAYS rename the final exe to dwarfdump2.exe 
 or dwarfdump2 to avoid naming conflicts on macosx: on mac dwarfdump is a standard executable provided with the base OS
 but this is not the same one as the one we build

note: since we need to install libelf to make it available for the build process of dwarfdump, 
 it is a good idea to do that on a temp system 

How to build:
 On windows, we build under mingw (using the standard stock path for installing mysys and mingw), 
 you must use libdwarf 20091012 or higher. 
 Then to build dwarfdump on windows: 
 first build libelf using: configure --prefix=mingw;make;make install
 then build libdwarf using: cd libdwarf;configure --enable-windowspath;make
 then build dwarfdump (not yet dwarfdump2): cd ../dwarfdump;configure --enable-windowspath;make
 the final exe is under the current directory: copy it it to the proper bin directory under script renaming it to dwarfdump2.exe
 copy dwarfdump.exe <somepath>\scripts\bin\win32\bin\dwarfdump2.exe
 
 On Linux and other *nix:
 build and install libelf: see the libelf ABOUT. 
 When done run additionally: sudo make install
 then for dwarfdump proper
 tar -xzf libdwarf-20081231.tar.gz
 cd dwarf-20081231/libdwarf
 ./configure
 make
 cd ../dwarfdump
 ./configure
 the final exe is under the current directory: copy it it to the proper bin directory under script renaming it to dwarfdump2
 cp dwarfdump  ~/dist/scripts-7974/trunk/scripts/bin/Linux-s390x/bin/dwarfdump2
 FINALLY: uninstall libelf installed above
 cd ../../../libelf/libelf-0.8.10/;sudo make uninstall
