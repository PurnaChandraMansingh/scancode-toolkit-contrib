he DWARF Debugging Information Format is of interest to
programmers working on compilers and debuggers.
It was developed by a committee starting around 1991. 
Starting around 1991 SGI developed the libdwarf and dwarfdump 
tools for internal use and as part of SGI IRIX developer tools.
Since that time dwarfdump and libdwarf
have been shipped 
(as an executable and archive respectively, not source)
with every release of the SGI MIPS/IRIX C compiler.
In 1994 (I think the correct year) 
SGI agreed (at my request) to open-source libdwarf 
(and in 1999 to open-source dwarfdump) so anyone could use them.

A comparison of DWARF3 with DWARF2 updated December 1, 2005, titled
<a href="dwarf3features.pdf">
"DWARF3: Better than DWARF2"
</a>
(pdf, 81736 bytes) might be of interest if you are interested
in how DWARF3 differs from DWARF2.
The source code is
<a href="dwarf3features.lyx">

lyx document preparation system).

All libdwarf distributions contain C source plus the DWARF2
specification plus libdwarf specifications.

<p>
Compilation will fail if libelf.h is missing (it's missing
from RedHat 9.0, for example, though libelf.a/.so is present).
In that case 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/directory/libs/misc/libelf.html">find
a libelf distribution to get libelf.h.</A>
</p>
<p>
Beginning in 2007 libelf.h may be distributed with a use of off64_t
as a data type. In 32bit Linux with some distributions either
_GNU_SOURCE or __USE_LARGEFILE64 must be defined before including
either sys/types.h or libelf.h: a plain include
of libelf.h will not compile.  
The configure scripts and some
coding in libdwarf/dwarfdump headers attempt to deal
with this as of December 2007 so that older and newer
libelf.h will work transparently (allowing libdwarf/dwarfump to build). 
As a result of the 2007 libelf.h off64_t
type you may see a warning from configure when plain libelf.h does not compile:
ignore that configure warning.

<font color=red><strong>HOT NEWS! Discovery 29 September 2008</strong></font>
A gcc version (GNU C 4.1.2 (Gentoo 4.1.2) -g) 
when generating 64-bit-offset-dwarf
targetting a MIPS64 little-endian platform 
(and perhaps other targets), generates line table
prologue <strong>header_length </strong> 
field with a value which is
exactly 12 too large.   A dwarfdump/libdwarf error
of DW_DLE_LINE_PROLOG_LENGTH_BAD (most libdwarf releases) or a Warning from
dwarfdump -l -v -v -v -v (libdwarf 20080929) indicates this error was
encountered.  Almost all gcc DWARF2 generation involves
32-bit-offset DWARF2 (even if the target machine has 64 bit pointers)
so it's very unlikely this bug will affect you.
As of the 20081012 release libdwarf works around this bug.
A gcc bug report is in the works according to Phil Mucci, who
provided an object file showing the bug (thanks Phil!).

A compiler was using DW_FORM_ref_addr form with a DW_AT_sibling
attribute, which was a surprise. Now we handle it and with
dwarfdump-ka we check the offset for correctness.
Added the -M option to dwarfdump which adds the name of
each attribute's form to the existing output.

problem and providing a non-proprietary test case.

Documented that dwarf_get_fde_n()

fde table.  
That was (sort of) always true, but
was not documented.
Fixed bogus error code in reading line tables.

This changes the libdwarf-internal implementation of
reading libelf so that the reader is not directly tied to libelf
or even elf.  Meaning a libdwarf can be built
that reads other object file types or that uses some library other
than libelf to do the reading (subject only to simple
constraints, see libdwarf.h).

Due to a typo, calling _dwarf_fde_section_offset()
(a interface which is still supported) would lead to an infinite loop
in libdwarf-20071209 and libdwarf-20080125.
The libdwarf producer forms code now allows more of the newer
attributes (so is more complete). Alloca is no longer used
anywhere (it was really only used one place).
The libdwarf producer code controlling the offset-size
is more sensible: standard DWARF (32 bit offsets) is the default, 
use configure --enable-dwarf-format-sgi-irix to get
IRIX 64bit offsets. See the libdwarf README 
and libdwarf2p.1.pdf for details.

The crucial dwarf_child() code could dereference a byte
off the end of a CU. Fixed.
Refactored .debug_frame code for clarity, performance,
elimination of duplicate code, and preparing to handle GNU eh_frame
(support for latest eh_frame not yet present).
Moved some sgi/irix only functions to separate source files
so most apps will get fewer bytes of libdwarf linked in.
If you have 834453 byte version, it is broken, delete it: revised to
834474 byte version.

The awk scripts in dwarfdump now allow multiple TAG names
with the same value to be handled: the first such
encountered is taken as the name dwarfdump uses.
For example, DW_TAG_template_type_parameter and
DW_TAG_template_type_param were both used in the DWARF2 spec,
and now dwarf.h allows both spellings by having two #defines
with the same value (DWARF3 specifies that DW_TAG_template_type_parameter
is the correct spelling).
